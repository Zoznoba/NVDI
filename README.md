Hi there.
This is a web-service for agricultural technologies, there we calculate NDVI for chosen area.
It's simple to use, first of all u need to get GeoJSON file with bounds of chosen area.
geojson.io - there u can mark out area and copy GeoJSON data.
After creating a GeoJSON file you can post it on 127.0.0.0:port/NDVI on your own local server and get image with highlighted NDVI area(example at imgs/map.png).
